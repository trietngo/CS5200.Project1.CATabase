CATabase Project for NEU CS5200
There are approximately 50-70 million feral cats in the United States, with some figures estimating at least 100 million without a home. Cats are natural predators and thus pose a serious threat to the local wildlife while also being at risk of being attacked by other cats, aggressive animals, or seriously injured by fast-moving vehicles. And yet, there are only about 2 million cats being adopted each year in the US. As such, a comprehensive cat adoption database will help people more easily connect with owners and shelters to adopt and reduce the number of vulnerable cats out in the elements.

How to Run:
1. Download .sql files
2. Using SQLite browsers, such as DB Browser for SQLite, execute the files to generate data and perform queries.
